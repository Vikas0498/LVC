                    <h1>Live Virtual Classroom</h1>
                    <p>There is no concrete definition of what a virtual classroom is, but the most logical one is simply that it is an online classroom environment facilitated via specialized video conferencing applications. The participants, of course, include one or multiple instructors and students. However, a classroom or class does not always need an active instructor to supervise students; in this setting, they can proceed at their own pace, with the instructor only around to evaluate the students; sometimes there is no instructor at all. This type of virtual classroom is called an unsupervised virtual classroom, which is characterized by ready-made learning materials that students can follow without the aid of an instructor, essentially a self-paced tutorial course where the exams can be automated after every activity. This is the most common form of virtual classroom, where students just read a PowerPoint presentation or watch a video tutorial. This makes YouTube, by association, the most widely used virtual classroom thus far (even if it is not considered as one).</p>
